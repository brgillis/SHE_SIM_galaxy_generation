        @brief
            Estimates galaxy intensity (in ADU) from signal-to-noise ratio.
 
        @details
            The definition used here is a simplified tophat model, with the tophat containing
           ~50% of the light for a circular galaxy and PSF. This definition is used simply
           because it's easy to analytically invert.
           
        @param galaxy_SN
            The signal-to-noise ratio of the galaxy.
        @param galaxy_stddev_arcsec
            The standard deviation of the (Gaussian) galaxy in units of arcsec.
        @param psf_stddev_arcsec
            The standard deviation of the (Gaussian) psf in units of arcsec.
        @param sky_level_subtracted
            The sky background level which has been previously subtracted off of the image, in units
            of ADU/arcsec^2
        @param sky_level_unsubtracted
            The sky background level which has not been previously subtracted off of the image, in units
            of ADU/arcsec^2
        @param read_noise
            The read noise of the observation, in units of e-/pixel
        @param pixel_scale
            The pixel scale of the image, in units of arcsec/pixel
        @param gain
            The gain of the observation, in units of e-/ADU
        
        @returns I
            The galaxy intensity in ADU
